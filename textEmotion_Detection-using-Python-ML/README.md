# Text Emotion Detection

For detecting emotions from the text, I will perform a few steps that will start with preparing the data. Then the next step will be tokenization where the textual data will be converted into tokens and from these tokens, we have to identify the emotional words.

These emotional words will be the keyword to classify the emotions of a text. Next, we’ll frame this task in such a way that a text will be taken as an input and the emoji that represents the emotions in that text is generated as the output.
